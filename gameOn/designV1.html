      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This page is a journey through my design process for the “Pumpkin Growing Contest” game. Players have two in-game weeks (about two minutes) to grow the
        biggest pumpkin using choices like watering, fertilizing, and avoiding pests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are my thumbnail sketches, full-size sketch with interaction notes, and a digital design composition that explores my final vision for this game.
      </p>

    <section class="block" id="thumbnails">
      <h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
      <p>
        I started with quick pencil thumbnails to explore different layouts for the
        timer, player gardens, and action buttons. These helped me decide on a
        split layout with P1 and P2 gardens and a clear callout area for the contest
        description.
      </p>

    <section class="block" id="sketch">
      <h2>Full-Size Sketch & Interactions</h2>
      <p>
        From the thumbnails, I chose one direction and sketched it larger. Here I
        mapped out the main interactions: clicking buttons to water or fertilize,
        a pest warning, and a day counter that advances over the two-week game
        period.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="block" id="comp">
      <h2>Digital Design Comp</h2>
      <p>
        Finally, I translated the sketch into a digital comp using a fall color
        palette and simple vector pumpkins. This version stays within a 1200 × 750
        viewport, keeps key elements above the fold, and begins to establish the
        typography and visual style I will use when coding the game.
