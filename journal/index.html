    <h2>Post 1 – Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
    <p><em>October 13, 2025</em></p>

    <p>The article “Best Practices for Form Design” reminded me how important simplicity is. I learned that users focus more on finishing the task than on reading labels, so clear structure and minimal fields matter. Grouping related questions, using inline validation, and keeping a single-column layout all help prevent frustration.</p>

    <p>One website that does this really well is Spotify’s sign-up form. Each field is short, the labels move smoothly, and error messages appear right where you need them. It feels like a conversation instead of a chore.</p>

    <p>Overall, the reading made me think about how much small design choices can make a big impact, even on something simple and boring like forms!</p>
