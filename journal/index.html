      <h2>Post 1 – Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
      <p><em>October 13, 2025</em></p>

      <p>The article “Best Practices for Form Design” reminded me how important simplicity is. I learned that users focus more on finishing the task than on reading labels, so clear structure and minimal fields matter. Grouping related questions, using inline validation, and keeping a single-column layout all help prevent frustration.</p>

      <p>One website that does this really well is Spotify’s sign-up form. Each field is short, the labels move smoothly, and error messages appear right where you need them. It feels like a conversation instead of a chore.</p>

      <p>Overall, the reading made me think about how much small design choices can make a big impact, even on something simple and boring like forms!</p>

      <h2>Post 2 – Overlays in Web Design: How to avoid misuing lightboxes.</h2>
      <p><em>October 20, 2025</em></p>

      <p>
        Nielsen Norman Group's article <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/"><em>"Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</em></a> does a wonderful job of pointing out how often overlays interrupt an immersive web experience rather than help it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The article highlights that overlays, especially in promotions or newsletter signups, tend to break up the flow of a webpage. Instead of guiding interaction, overlays can often force it. This can lead to sites feeling pushy and unprofessional, deterring users.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea that overlays should earn their place on a site through providing real value at the right time in user interaction is fascinating. A pop-up confirming a critical action, like deleting a file, is a good example of when overlays are effective and also almost taken for granted. But those pop-ups for newletters and subscriptions the minute a user lands on a page? Not so valuable to the site's design. 
      </p>

      <p>
        As designers, it's important to understand when a layout needs a flashy overlay or form pop-up, and when to integrate content more naturally into the flow of the page. It's crucial that users feel in control rather than cornered.
