    <h2>Post 3 – Visual Thinking and Interaction With Imagery</h2>
    <p><em>October 27, 2025</em></p> 
    
    <p>
      The article <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/"><em>“10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills”</em></a> explains how much information and storytelling can exist within a single image. It reminded me that looking at visuals is never passive. We are always interpreting, noticing details, and making meaning whether we realize it or not. 
    </p> 
    
    <p> 
      While exploring examples of visual thinking in interaction design, I found the Awwwards site <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/untold-1"><em>We Tell Untold Stories</em></a>. The whole experience is driven by imagery and motion. You scroll through layered photographs that shift and animate, and it pulls you into the narrative almost like a documentary. It shows how interaction can enhance the story instead of distracting from it.

      It was interesting to see how typography alone can communicate tone and personality before any words are read. Overall, this assignment made me think more about how visuals guide us emotionally and help us understand content quicker than text ever could. Here is the collection of free typefaces I enjoyed browsing through: <br><a href="https://www.awwwards.com/best-free-fonts.html">https://www.awwwards.com/best-free-fonts.html</a>.

      <h2>Post 2 – Overlays in Web Design: How to avoid misuing lightboxes.</h2>
      <p><em>October 20, 2025</em></p>

      <p>
        Nielsen Norman Group's article <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/"><em>"Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</em></a> does a wonderful job of pointing out how often overlays interrupt an immersive web experience rather than help it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The article highlights that overlays, especially in promotions or newsletter signups, tend to break up the flow of a webpage. Instead of guiding interaction, overlays can often force it. This can lead to sites feeling pushy and unprofessional, deterring users.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea that overlays should earn their place on a site through providing real value at the right time in user interaction is fascinating. A pop-up confirming a critical action, like deleting a file, is a good example of when overlays are effective and also almost taken for granted. But those pop-ups for newletters and subscriptions the minute a user lands on a page? Not so valuable to the site's design. 
      </p>

      <p>
        As designers, it's important to understand when a layout needs a flashy overlay or form pop-up, and when to integrate content more naturally into the flow of the page. It's crucial that users feel in control rather than cornered.

      <h2>Post 1 – Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
      <p><em>October 13, 2025</em></p>

      <p>The article “Best Practices for Form Design” reminded me how important simplicity is. I learned that users focus more on finishing the task than on reading labels, so clear structure and minimal fields matter. Grouping related questions, using inline validation, and keeping a single-column layout all help prevent frustration.</p>

      <p>One website that does this really well is Spotify’s sign-up form. Each field is short, the labels move smoothly, and error messages appear right where you need them. It feels like a conversation instead of a chore.</p>

      <p>Overall, the reading made me think about how much small design choices can make a big impact, even on something simple and boring like forms!</p>
