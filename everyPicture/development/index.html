          Moving forwards with this project, I want to make the webpage seem more immersive. After peer review and discussion, the main points from my notes were to incoporate the backgrounds into a more organic feel to further the forest and buggy vibe of my site, as well as make it more of an eye-spy stylized search.

          Below are my main edits and ideas moving forwards. I created collages of images and text I have to make a more diverse background that is funky and fits the forest vibe. My next step is to experiment with an x-ray style search or experiment with hover and zoom effects inside the overlay secondary pictures.
